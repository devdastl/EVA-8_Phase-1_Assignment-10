# EVA-8_Phase-1_Assignment-10
This is the assignment of 10th session in Phase-1 of EVA-8 from TSAI
## Introduction

### Objective
This assignment has two part objective:
1. Perform experimentation with Conv mixer model. Test this architecture with our custom writtern architecture, etc.
2. Re-write ViT code such that all the linear layers are replaced by Convolution layers in attention mechanism. 
### Repository structure
## Data representation
## ConvMixer implementation
## ViT based on convolution
### ViT introduction
## Result & Conclusion
